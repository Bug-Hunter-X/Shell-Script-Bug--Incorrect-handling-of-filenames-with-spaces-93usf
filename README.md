This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in shell scripts: incorrect handling of filenames containing spaces.  The `bug.sh` script iterates through a list of files. However, if a filename includes spaces, the loop incorrectly interprets the space as a separator, leading to unexpected behavior or errors in commands that process the files. The `bugSolution.sh` file provides a corrected version that uses array expansion correctly, ensuring proper handling of filenames with spaces.
